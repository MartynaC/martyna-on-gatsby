The concert deals with the topic of positive disintegration, i.e. the theory of mental health, which assumes that mental health is a dynamic mental process, not a state. Working with Teoniki Rozynek as a music composer, we tried to present various stages and levels of development that lead to the creation of a coherent, compact structure of personality traits corresponding to the harmony and internal balance of a human being.
